# CS-305

    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
The client, Artemis Financial, is a financial consulting company that looks to modernize their operations. This would mean to address creating secure, custom software to verify and protect client data and information.

    What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
What I personally found I did well was researching fixes and vulnerabilities to figure out which were valid. Overall, maintaining software security adds a value of trust in both the software and the company utilizing it.

    Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Searching through and researching vulnerabilities through the static tests was not only helpful, as it allowed to learn more about software and their interactions and how vulnerabilities were caused, but also interesting.

    How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
One of the aspects of security that was increased was implementing HTTPS for secure connections. Something that I would use in the future to assess vulnerabilities is manual inspection of the code base, not just to only rely on certain tests to make sure software is secure.

    How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Making sure to look over build successes and tests run as well as manual inspection were important to making certain the code was secure. After refactoring, to make sure no new vulnerabilities occurred, tests and dependency checks could be run again to be certain.

    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
As a resource, utilizing Maven and OWASP to check for vulnerabilities can be made part of a routine practice that could prove useful in future tasks.

    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I might show aspects of generating certificates and checksums as something to show in the future, as they both touch on security and coding practice aspects.
